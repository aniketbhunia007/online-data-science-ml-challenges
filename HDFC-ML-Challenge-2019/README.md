# HDFC-ML-Challenge
Banking Behavioral Scorecard for Internal Liability Customers, organized by HackerEarth Platform. <br/> <br/>
Your task is to build a banking behavioral scorecard model for internal customers through a
user's liability account and predict the credit risk. These are low transacting customers. The
definition that is used for the target variable is every 30+ or X+ days delinquent twice in forward
months.
The implementations of the model are as follows:
1. Pre-approving customers for cross-selling other products of a bank.
2. Decide the mode of treatment of customers and specify it as an input for credit
underwriting.
