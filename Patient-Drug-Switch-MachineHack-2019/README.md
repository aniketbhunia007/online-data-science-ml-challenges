# Patient Drug Switch
Detailed Analysis and Prediction for whether the customer would switch the drug or not?

# Problem Statement:
Armanik, a multinational pharmaceutical company based in Texas, USA, is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies by both market capitalization and sales. Armanik manufactures drugs across multiple therapy areas â€“ Cardiovascular, Diabetes, HIV and Immunology therapy. Their innovative SGLT 2 is the market leader in diabetes therapy. Recently, the company announced that they have successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for an Anti-TNF drug in Rheumatoid Arthritis therapeutic. The company expects to get approval for its new drug in the next 6 months. Given the competition in the market, Prakash Vishwanathan, CEO of Armanik, has reached out to ZS to help identify the patient population in the U.S who are likely to switch any product in the RA market. ZS has proposed a machine learning-based approach using medical transactional data to first identify the factors that are most closely associated with the switching RA patients that will help predict patients who are likely to switch in the near term.
