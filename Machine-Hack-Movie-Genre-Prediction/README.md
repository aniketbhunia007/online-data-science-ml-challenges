# Problem Statement - Movie Genre Prediction
Provided the entire script of the movie, can you classify it into the right genre.

Labeling text data can be hard. To use the available information to auto-create or predict the labels can be an interesting machine learning task. Using the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) the unstructured text data can be leveraged to auto-generate the right classes for the test data in the future.

In order to accomplish this, we have scraped close to 2000 movie scripts and the respective genres.

As some of the scripts are huge, it would be interesting to figure out new ways of feature extraction and different NLP techniques.

In this hackathon participants are challenged to use the movie script to design a Natural language processing system that can help the customer classify it into the right genre in the coming future.
